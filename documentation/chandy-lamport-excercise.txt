Ans 1:
V -> nodes in graph
E -> number of edges
The message complexity is O(|V| * |E|) as in the worst case, every nodes sends a message to all its connected neighbours atleast once.
Time complexity is O(|V|) as again, every node sends a message to all its connected neighbours at least once, which we assume takes unit time

Ans 2:

A simple solution is to maintain the path from initiator during the flooding phase of our algorithm.

When a process is marked as recorded, it has the path from the initiator passed to it by its neighbour.
Now, after saving its state, it can simply forward the recorded state back up this path in a directed manner.

In this way, each node forwards the state back to a directed path, and we achieve O(N) dissemination
